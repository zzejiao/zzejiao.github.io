This is a Quarto website.

Hey everyone welcome to my second personal website.

Before I've tried to build a personal site using Hugo Framework and it was so fun doing that. 
However I didn't really manage that site very well and didn't update any more blogs anfter a month.

I'm currently taking the MDS program in UBC and one small part of my labs required me to build a site using Quarto.

Hope I will comeback soon and start working on my portfolio and maybe post some blogs!

Best,
Jiao
